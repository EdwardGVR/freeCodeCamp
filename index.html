                    <p><b>David Jon Gilmour</b>, CBE (born 6 March 1946) is an English guitarist, singer and songwriter 
                    who was a member of the progressive rock band Pink Floyd. He joined the group as guitarist 
                    and co-lead vocalist in 1968 shortly before the departure of founding member Syd Barrett.[1] 
                    Pink Floyd subsequently achieved international success with the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, 
                    Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall. By the early 1980s, they had become one of the bestselling 
                    and most acclaimed acts in music history; by 2012, the band had sold over 250 million records worldwide, 
                    including 75 million units sold in the United States.[2] Following the departure of Roger Waters in 1985, 
                    Gilmour assumed leadership of Pink Floyd; they released three more studio albums before disbanding in 2014.</p>

                    <p>Gilmour has produced a variety of artists, such as the Dream Academy, and has released four solo studio 
                    albums: David Gilmour, About Face, On an Island, and Rattle That Lock. He is also credited for bringing 
                    songwriter Kate Bush to public attention. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the US Rock and 
                    Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. In 2005, Gilmour was made a Commander of 
                    the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to music.[3] He was awarded with the Outstanding 
                    Contribution title at the 2008 Q Awards.[4] In 2011, Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 14 in their 
                    list of the greatest guitarists of all time.[5] He was voted number 36 in the greatest voices in rock by 
                    Planet Rock listeners in 2009.[6]</p>
